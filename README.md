WebService for Tenable.

Tenable SC scan results in pdf format and the results sent via email often stop when passing through the email server with attachment size limitations. An alternative way, we can use the Publishing Server in Tenable SC, but not all organizations can provide a Publishing Server that is compatible with Tenable SC. The easy solution, we can create our own webservice that can be used to receive HTTP POST results on Tenable SC and save the scan results. After you use this webservice, scan results that are subject to size limitations are a thing of the past.
